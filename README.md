# highload-handling
In this repository,  I share docs and useful contents to handle and test highload applications.

# Performance testing
Performance testing enables you to simulate user traffic, so you can observe how your API behaves under load and 
find out if the performance meets expectations. It can also help you identify any issues or bottlenecks that affect performance.

# K6 testing 
Grafana k6 is an open-source load testing tool that makes performance testing easy and productive for engineering teams. 
k6 is free, developer-centric, and extensible.

Using k6, you can test the reliability and performance of your systems and catch performance regressions and problems earlier. 
k6 will help you to build resilient and performant applications that scale.

"*K6 is written in Golang*"
