/*

Smoke tests have a minimal load. Run them to verify that the system works well under minimal load and to 
gather baseline performance values.

This test type consists of running tests with a few VUs â€” more than 5 VUs could be considered a mini-load test.

Similarly, the test should execute for a short period, either a low number of iterations or a duration 
from seconds to a few minutes maximum.

It's a good practice to run a smoke test as a first step, with the following goals:
    - Verify that your test script doesn't have errors.
    - Verify that your system doesn't throw any errors (performance or system related) when under minimal load.
    - Gather baseline performance metrics of your systemâ€™s response under minimal load.
    - With simple logic, to serve as a synthetic test to monitor the performance and availability of production environments.
