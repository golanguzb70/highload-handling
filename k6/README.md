# Why to test?
1. To check your API performance. 
2. To  check your app stability. 
3. To check how many users can be handled by your application.

# What is k6?
Grafana k6 is an open-source load testing tool that makes performance testing easy and productive for engineering teams. k6 is free, developer-centric, and extensible.

Using k6, you can test the reliability and performance of your systems and catch performance regressions and problems earlier. k6 will help you to build resilient and performant applications that scale.

# 4 types of performance testing. 
1. Load testing
2. Stress testing
3. Spike testing
4. Soak testing

# Load testing
Load Testing is a type of Performance Testing that determines the performance of a system, software product, or software application under real-life based load conditions. Basically, load testing determines the behavior of the application when multiple users use it at the same time.

See example of load testing [here.](https://github.com/golanguzb70/highload-handling/tree/main/k6/load)

# Stress testing
Stress testing is defined as a type of software testing that verifies the stability and reliability of the system. This test particularly determines the system on its robustness and error handling under extremely heavy load conditions.
